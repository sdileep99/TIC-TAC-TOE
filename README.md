# TIC-TAC-TOE
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript
In this article, we will create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game using JavaScript.
We will be using validation checks to implement the game features.
The UI is designed using CSS so it is easy to create. In the game, Player-1 starts playing the game and both players make their moves in consecutive turns. 
The player who makes a straight 3-block chain wins the game.
This game is built on the front-end using simple logic and validation checks only.
